High priority, required for initial release:
  - slash commands (please)
        also includes private responses if, for example, the cooldown doesn't allow a ping yet (Ephemeral)
        this might make #bot-channel largely irrelevant due to 1-on-1 interactions
        May want to turn this off in some channels
    buttons for next / previous list page
    thread support

Medium priority, you can expect these in the initial release:
    buttons for proposed list instead of reactions
    Add message links to +listProposals
  - list search / filter
    member join / leave responses
  - list aliases
    neater formatting, possibly more embeds
    context menu for ping reply to
    proposal form, including description?
    Automatic logging for a channel / role.

Low priority, often either complicated or less useful:
    list groups / collections?
    ping message / description (that can be added when using /ping)
    timed responses? possibly, quite a rabbit hole

TODO
    sql injection protection
    permission system
    cooldown checks
