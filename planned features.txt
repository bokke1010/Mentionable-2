High priority, required for initial release:
  v slash commands (please)
        also includes private responses if, for example, the cooldown doesn't allow a ping yet (Ephemeral)
        this might make #bot-channel largely irrelevant due to 1-on-1 interactions
        May want to turn this off in some channels
  v buttons for next / previous list page
  v thread support

Medium priority, you can expect these in the initial release:
  v buttons for proposed list instead of reactions
  x Add message links to +listProposals
  v list search / filter
  o member join / leave responses
  v list aliases
  ~ neater formatting, possibly more embeds
  x context menu for ping reply to
  x proposal form, including description?
  o Automatic logging for a channel / role.
  ~ user exceptions

Low priority, often either complicated or less useful:
  x list groups / collections?
  x ping message / description (that can be added when using /ping)
  x timed responses? possibly, quite a rabbit hole

TODO
  ~ permission system
  v cooldown checks
